title: About Taormina
main_description: >-
  Simple - they have all sojourned in Taormina, the pearl of the Mediterranean.


  Idyllicly perched on a rocky promontory high above the sea, Taormina has been the most popular tourist destination in Sicily for a couple of hundred of years, ever since it became an integral part of the Grand Tour. Beautifully restored mediaeval buildings, breathtaking views around every corner and a giddy network of winding streets strewn with shops, bars and restaurants make for a perfect holiday spot.


  > Taormina’s past is Sicily’s history in a microcosm: Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Normans, Swabians, the French and the Spanish all came, saw, conquered and left.


  Tauromenium, built on Monte Tauro, was founded by Andromacus at the behest of Dionysius the Tyrant of [Syracuse](https://www.thethinkingtraveller.com/italy/sicily/towns-and-cities-in-sicily/syracuse) in 392 BCE. The first Punic War saw Taormina falling to the Romans in 212BCE and the town became a favourite holiday spot for Patricians and Senators, thus starting Taormina’s long history as a tourist resort.
