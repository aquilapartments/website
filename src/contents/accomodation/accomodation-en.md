  The 90 m² apartment has 2 bedrooms (1 double bed and 2 single beds and two
  bathrooms with shower / toilet / bidet / vanity).


  There is also a spacious living and dining area (including two additional beds) and a functional fireplace. The apartment is furnished to a very high standard (designer furniture) and has a large screen TV, WIFI and a sound system. The large balcony (ideal for breakfast and dinner) offers enough space and, like the whole house, offers a wonderful view over the Ionian Sea and the old town of Taormina.


  The apartment has a fully equipped kitchen with a stove, high quality microwave, dishwasher and refrigerator as well as a variety of electrical appliances and all the necessary dishes for a good meal.


  Each room is equipped with air conditioning.


  The windows are triple-glazed, so the apartment is quiet when the windows are closed. In the summer months, Corso Umberto and the adjacent streets are very busy until around 1 a.m.


  The house is absolutely centrally located in one of the most beautiful squares (Piazza Varò) and only 100 steps away from Corso Umberto and the landmark Piazza IX Aprile.
